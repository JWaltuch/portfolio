            I studied both theatre and computer science in college. After
            pursuing theatre for a while, developing leadership and
            communication skills, I couldn’t turn away from my passion for
            coding. I rediscovered my love of it through self-study, then
            attended the Grace Hopper program to refine my skills. I love
            puzzling problems, building apps, and writing code. In my ideal
            role, I will have room to grow and plenty of learning opportunities.
            My goal is to use my technical abilities to make a positive impact.

            When I'm not coding, I'm trying to find the tastiest desserts and
            New York City's best chocolate chip cookie. Ask me for
            recommendations. Be forewarned: I can talk about food and dessert at
            length.

          <h3>Corona Tracker</h3>
          <div>
            CoronaTracker is an easy-to-use and accessible progressive web
            application that helps you monitor your wellness and stay informed
            during the COVID-19 crisis, designed by an open-source community
            invested in public health.
          </div>
          <div>
            For this app, I contributed by building many front-end features with
            React and Material UI, such as the crucial feature allowing users
            the option to delete their sensitive medical data. I also wrote
            tests for the Redux actions responsible for handling that data.

            For this app, I focused on a mobile-compatible design. I also

          <div>
            For this app, which is meant to be soothing in times of stress, I

          <h3>Surprise Me!</h3>
          <div>
            Surprise Me! is the best way to surprise your friends and family
            with gifts they actually want. You can share your wishlist with
            others and they can all pick out gifts for you with no overlap, but
            you'll never know what you're going to get.
          </div>
          <div>
            To enable the crucial functionality of this app - the prevention of
            gift overlap - I leveraged sockets and Firebase Realtime Database,
            so the webapp would update with the database in real time. I also
            utilized a NoSQL database.

            This mobile game app lets players go on a scavenger hunts,
            determining where to go by answering riddles. Users can either see
            where they stand on a map or see the AR view through their camera
            lens, where treasure chests pop up before their eyes!

            I led backend operations for this app, as well as made significant
